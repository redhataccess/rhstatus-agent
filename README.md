# Red Hat Status agent

This is the agent meant to feed https://github.com/redhataccess/rhstatus data from various geos.  This app works but is in alpha stage.

# Installation

npm install

# Running

```
npm run start
```

# TBD

* Read the geo from configuration so it can be parameterized per GEO deployment
* Read the external itos mongo instance from the configuration and write to that mongo instance
* Ensure that itos can be written to 'externally'
